# OSE-Statblock-Generator
A work-in-progress statblock generator for OSE. Still in testing, code is a mess... but hopefully works?

Based HEAVILY on Tetra-Cube's wonderful 5E statblock generator, available [here](https://tetra-cube.com/dnd/dnd-statblock.html).

#### To dos:
1. default load-outs for each hit dice level
2. a few default monsters
3. editing the stat names (eg changing the AC label)
- x. editing which AC and THAC0 display within the stat block based on the selector
- x. changing the THAC0 based on asc/desc armor class
6. formatting the abilities and statblock overall
7. formatting the abilities in the display list
8. attacks better
9. custom alignment
- x. fix alignment bug
11. custom hit points, and hit point calculation, and no hit dice
12. safer saving throw editing - being able to edit the name of the saving throw as well as the value independently
13. edit in place abilities list
14. delete abilities from ability display list when deleted from stat block
