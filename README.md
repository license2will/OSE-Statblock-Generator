#### How to use:

1. Choose a monster preset from the drop-down menu or just go with the default. You can upload pre-made statblocks in JSON format using the **Load Statblock** button.
2. Use the form on the page to modify the monster's stats. You can also edit the monster directly in the stat-block, and your changes will be saved when you click off the statblock.
3. Add special abilities at the bottom of the page.
4. When you're finished editing, hit **Update Statblock** to save your changes.
5. Save your statblock as a JSON file or image using the buttons up the top, or view a printable block or the markdown for the statblock.
6. Profit!
